A pretty standard catch and avoid type game. Essentially a way for me to learn the basics of pygame. 

I haven't converted it to an app yet, so this is still only accessible to people with python and pygame installed. 
Just download all the files into a folder, and it should run.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
